📖 Short Story: The Lost Note

The last train was almost empty.
Fluorescent lights flickered above, casting a pale glow over the rows of silent seats.

As the train slowed, Anna noticed something under the bench across from her—a neatly folded piece of paper.
Curiosity won. She picked it up and unfolded it with care.

Inside, a single sentence was written in hurried but beautiful handwriting:

“Tomorrow, at 8 p.m., meet me by the old clock tower if you are willing.”

There was no name.
No clue of who it might be for.

Anna’s heart skipped a beat.
The paper trembled slightly in her hand. She looked around the carriage—no one was watching her, no one seemed to have dropped it.

That night, she couldn’t sleep. Questions echoed in her mind.
Who left the note? Was it a mistake? Or… was it destiny?

The next evening, Anna found herself walking through the quiet streets of the old town. The clock tower rose above the square, dark and ancient, its bell silent for the moment.
The air smelled faintly of rain.

At exactly 8 p.m., the bell tolled.
She stood there, holding her breath.

Footsteps approached from behind.

Turning slowly, Anna saw a man in a grey coat, his face partly hidden by the brim of his hat.
He stopped a few steps away, looked directly at her, and smiled with a kind of relief—as if he had been waiting for this moment for years.

“Thank you,” he said softly. “For coming at last.”
